• There were not really any huge decisions we had to make. Some decisions included what type of data structures to use such as Vector vs ArrayList vs HashMap, which we ultimately decided on Vectors and HashMaps because they were more familiar to us. We also decided to write the Iterator Classes within the class itself to avoid making new files. 

• I don’t think we made any huge changes to the API. However, since we used NetBeans to code the project (since Eclipse completely failed on us), NetBeans might have added a dependency, but we’re not sure. However, our ant tests on our computers worked, so I think things should work fine on yours as well. 
 
• For the purposes of Lab 1, we don’t seem to be missing any elements of the required code, and all tests pass on our machines. 
 
• Many hours were spent. We estimate approximately 10-15 hours, some of which included trying to get Eclipse to work which, as stated above, failed on us. The only real difficult parts were learning Java, but after a level of familiarity was reached, it wasn’t too difficult to understand.
