-We chose to estimate selectivity as described in the exercises, where we estimate
the expected count for any value by dividing the height of the bucket by the width.
For the join optimizer, we followed and implemented the algorithm given in the exercise.
-No changes were made to other functions.
-This lab took a decent amount of time, the procedure was easy to follow. Only issues were
with edge cases in selectivity estimation.
