•There weren’t many design choices to be made outside of variable types and the iterator classes. 
•We declared some class attributes to hold data, which is necessary for the classes to function. Apart from that, no changes were made to the API outside of the designated functions.
•All code that is necessary for the Lab 1 tests to run successfully is included. Apart from that, there’s nothing else that was tested or implemented, so it’s unclear whether code is missing from those functions and classes.
•We spent about 10-15 hours, and the hardest part was getting Eclipse to run, and after a while
